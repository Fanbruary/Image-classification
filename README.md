# Image-classification
The main objective of this project is to produce a deep learning model
that can correctly identify the content of the images without the help of
any human being. 
With the help of CNN and Tensoflow, my final model achieved the accuracy of 90%
on my training dataset (4500 images with 3 classes) and 85% on the test data provided
by tutors.

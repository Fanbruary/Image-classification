# Image-classification
## intro
The main objective of this project is to produce a deep learning model
that can correctly identify the content of the images (cherry, tomato or strawberry) without the help of
any human being. </br>

## result
With the help of CNN and Tensoflow, my final model achieved the accuracy of 90%
on my training dataset (4500 images with 3 classes) and 85% on the test data provided
by tutors.

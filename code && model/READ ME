For running my model on test data, simple put my model file under a folder named 'model',
where the folder that contain 'model' folder also has a folder named data with three seperate folders
about three classes in it.

The training data of my train.ipyns is stored locally on lab computer

Regarding the file format is different between my test and train,
I was using terminal to complie and test my test.py to test my model, but I was using jupyter book
to work my the trainning code which can produce my CNN model.
